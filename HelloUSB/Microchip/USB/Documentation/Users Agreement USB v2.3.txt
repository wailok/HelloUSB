The Software and Documentation are licensed under this Agreement and not sold.  The Software and Documentation are protected by U.S. copyright laws and international copyright treaties, and other intellectual property laws and treaties.

In consideration of the mutual covenants of the parties and for the consideration received herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

Licensee shall have no right to modify, use, copy, license, create derivative works of, sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software or the Proprietary Rights for the Software except as expressly set forth in the Agreement.  Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, all uses of the Proprietary Rights of the Software hereunder, including hardware, firmware and software implementations of the technology, will inure to the benefit of the Company, and any all equities or rights in and to the Proprietary Rights of the Software resulting from Licensee's acts or endeavors hereunder will automatically transfer to the Company. 

2.	License Grant.
	
(a)	Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Company grants, strictly to Licensee, a personal, worldwide, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce, market, license, distribute, use and create derivative works of the Software, solely for incorporation into a product manufactured by Licensee which only implements the Software on proprietary products manufactured by Company and purchased by Licensee from Company or Company’s authorized distributor (a “Device”).  The product produced by the Licensee which integrates a Device programmed with the Software shall hereafter be called a “Licensee Product.”  The Company also grants, strictly to Licensee, a personal, worldwide, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Documentation in support of Licensee’s authorized use of the Software.

(b)	Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may grant a limited sublicense to a third party (“Sublicensee”) of the rights granted to Licensee in Section 2(a) above with the following additional limitations.  Such sublicense shall permit the Sublicensee to use the Software only as described below in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) through 2(b)(v) and only IF such Sublicensee expressly agrees in writing to be bound by terms of confidentiality and limited use that are no broader in scope and duration than the confidentiality and limited use terms of this Agreement:
(i)	Sublicensee may modify source code solely for use by Licensee.
(ii)	Sublicensee may program Software into Devices for Licensee.
(iii)	Sublicensee may use the Software to develop and/or manufacture Licensee Products.
(iv)	Sublicensee may use the Software to develop and/or manufacture products where either: (x) the sublicensed Software contains source code modified or otherwise optimized by Licensee for Sublicensee use and the Software is implemented only on proprietary products manufactured by Company and purchased from Company or Company’s authorized distributor; or (y) the sublicensed Software is programmed into a Device by Licensee on behalf of such Sublicensee.
(v)	Sublicensee may use the Documentation in support of Sublicensee’s authorized use of the Software in conformance with this Section 2(b).

Sublicensee shall have no right to further sublicense any right granted under this Agreement.

(c)	Authorized representatives of the Company shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee’s or Sublicensee’s premises and to audit Licensee’s or Sublicensee’s records and inventory of products in which the Software is implemented, whether located on Licensee’s or Sublicensee’s premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's and Sublicensee’s adherence to the terms of this Agreement.

3.	Licensee Obligations.

For purposes of clarity, Licensee’s use of the Software binary driver file on a Windows® operating system to interface with a Device does not violate this Section 3(a). 

(b)	Licensee will not, during the term of this Agreement or any time thereafter, attack, dispute or contest, directly or indirectly, the Company's exclusive right, title and interest in or to the Proprietary Rights of the Software or the validity of the Company's ownership thereof, nor will Licensee assist or encourage others to do so.

6.	Injunctive Relief.  Licensee agrees that the provisions in this Agreement regarding unauthorized use of the Software and nondisclosure are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company.  Licensee also agrees that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate the Company if there is a violation of such provisions by Licensee and that injunctive relief against Licensee is essential for the protection of the Company.  Licensee agrees, therefore, that if the Company alleges that Licensee has breached or violated such provisions then, in addition to any other remedies it may have, the Company will have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction, with the requirement for the posting of a bond, for injunctive relief against Licensee in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.

If a party is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.  Licensee's obligation under this Section 7 will survive for a period of twenty (20) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
